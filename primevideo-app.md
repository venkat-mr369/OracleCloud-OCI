Here is an in-depth, ready-to-copy structure you can use in MS Word for designing and explaining a global-scale application like Prime Video, deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Each section describes the role of the service, technical best practices, and analytical considerations—this will help you build, secure, and scale your application across regions.

# Global Prime Video Application on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

## 1. **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)**

- **Explanation:**  
  The VCN acts as your private, logically isolated network in OCI, similar to a regional data center for your app. Every resource—compute instances, databases, load balancers, storage—is provisioned inside a VCN.
- **Technical Design:**  
  - Create a dedicated VCN in each OCI region you plan to serve.
  - Use non-overlapping IP ranges for each region (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16 for US, 10.1.0.0/16 for EU, etc.).
  - Set up VCN Peering for secure cross-region communication if global service discovery or replication is needed.
- **Analysis:**
  - Enables segmented, secure, and compliant deployment.
  - Facilitates granular traffic management for multi-region streaming delivery.

## 2. **Subnets (Public & Private)**

- **Explanation:**  
  Subnets segment your VCN. Public subnets expose resources (like load balancers) to the internet; private subnets keep backend resources internal.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Public Subnet: Hosts load balancers, bastion hosts.
  - Private Subnet: Houses app servers, databases, caches.
  - Use network security groups for fine-grained access control between subnets.
- **Analysis:**
  - Granular separation ensures public-facing components are isolated from sensitive backend/data.
  - Simplifies compliance for global privacy and content restrictions.

## 3. **Firewalls & Security Rules**

- **Explanation:**  
  OCI uses security lists and network security groups to implement firewall rules.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Apply restrictive ingress rules (allow only necessary protocols/ports from valid sources).
  - Enable egress rules selectively; for backends, limit outbound internet access strictly.
  - For multi-region, automate security policies for consistency.
- **Analysis:**
  - Minimizes attack surface.
  - Meets security standards (PCI, CIS benchmarks) for global content platforms.

## 4. **Load Balancer**

- **Explanation:**  
  OCI’s Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic to your compute instances.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Deploy Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) load balancers in every region.
  - Use health checks and connection draining for seamless video streaming.
  - Enable SSL termination; optionally, re-encrypt to backend for additional security.
- **Analysis:**
  - Ensures high availability and optimal user experience.
  - Supports auto-scaling backend pools for sudden traffic surges (e.g., new release, live events).

## 5. **Compute Instances & Kubernetes (OCI Container Engine - OKE)**

- **Explanation:**  
  Compute is the backbone; you can use VM instances for legacy workloads, and OKE/Kubernetes for microservices and streaming APIs.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Deploy stateless microservices for video catalog, recommendations, and streaming control in Kubernetes (OKE).
  - Provision GPU or high-CPU instances for encoding/transcoding workloads.
  - Autoscale node pools based on demand.
- **Analysis:**
  - OKE maximizes developer productivity and operational flexibility.
  - Enables rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and disaster recovery.

## 6. **Object Storage**

- **Explanation:**  
  This is your media storage layer; stores raw, compressed, and encoded video files.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Organize content in dedicated buckets by region, genre, or quality.
  - Enable pre-signed URLs for temporary downloads/streaming.
  - Use lifecycle rules for automatic archiving or deletion.
- **Analysis:**
  - Virtually unlimited, cost-effective storage—content is highly durable and available globally.
  - Integrates with CDNs for fast delivery anywhere.

## 7. **Block & File Storage**

- **Explanation:**  
  Used for application state, logs, transcoding scratch space, or media asset archives.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Attach Block Volumes to critical compute instances.
  - Use File Storage for shared access across multiple containers or VMs.
- **Analysis:**
  - Supports persistent, high-performance workloads (e.g., live encoding, logs).
  - Facilitates distributed editing or processing pipelines.

## 8. **Databases**

### a) **Relational Database (MySQL/MariaDB/Autonomous)**
- **Explanation:**  
  Store user accounts, transactions, playlists, and core app data.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Use Oracle Autonomous Database for serverless, automatic patching and tuning.
  - Global Data Guard for cross-region replication and DR.
  - High IOPS storage for user-facing tables.
- **Analysis:**
  - Strong consistency and ACID transactions.
  - Self-healing, auto-scaling, and regulatory compliance across data residency requirements.

### b) **NoSQL Database (Oracle NoSQL Database, DynamoDB, Cassandra)**
- **Explanation:**  
  Power recommendations, real-time analytics, watch history, and session data.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Partition tables by user or region; use replicated stores for global speed.
  - Set tunable consistency/latency as per workload (e.g., strong for billing, eventual for analytics).
- **Analysis:**
  - Massively scalable and low-latency, supports personalized viewing at scale.
  - Allows for online schema upgrades and flexible query models.

## 9. **File and Content Delivery (CDN)**

- **Explanation:**  
  Uses OCI CDN or third-party CDN to cache and deliver video across the globe.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Integrate Object Storage with CDN endpoints.
  - Regional edge nodes cache popular content for low-latency access.
- **Analysis:**
  - Minimal buffering, instant playback—key for user retention.
  - Reduces infrastructure load and egress costs.

## 10. **Monitoring, Logging, and Analytics**

- **Explanation:**  
  Comprehensive insight into infrastructure and application health.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Use OCI Monitoring for all instances, databases, storage, and network health.
  - Push logs to OCI Logging and integrate with alerts for critical events.
  - Use Application Performance Monitoring (APM) for end-to-end user journey analysis.
- **Analysis:**
  - Proactive detection of outages or slowdowns.
  - Analytics drive continuous improvement, A/B testing, and strategic rollout.

## 11. **Identity, Access, and Compliance**

- **Explanation:**  
  Control access to every resource; enforce regulatory and licensing requirements.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Use OCI Identity and Access Management (IAM) for RBAC and least-privilege visibility.
  - Integrate SSO with enterprise identity providers.
  - Set up audit and compliance policies by region.
- **Analysis:**
  - Meets global standards (GDPR, SOC2).
  - Automates user onboarding/offboarding and permission reviews.

## 12. **Disaster Recovery & High Availability**

- **Explanation:**  
  Multi-region deployment ensures business continuity even during failures.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Cross-region backups of databases and objects.
  - Active-active application clusters or warm standbys in secondary regions.
  - Automated failover for key services.
- **Analysis:**
  - Near-zero downtime; seamless failover for critical components.
  - SLA-driven design safeguards reputation and revenue.

## 13. **DevOps and CI/CD**

- **Explanation:**  
  Enables rapid, reliable application development and rollout.
- **Technical Design:**
  - Integrate OCI DevOps or third-party (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) for pipeline automation.
  - Implement blue-green and canary deployments per region.
- **Analysis:**
  - Frequent, error-free updates enhance feature delivery and security posture.
  - Code-to-cloud automation ensures global uniformity and compliance.
